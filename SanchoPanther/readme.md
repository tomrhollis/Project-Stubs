# Sancho Panther, All-Purpose Sidekick

This is the beginnings of a sprawling project of personal automation, starting with budgeting and task management.

There are MANY other projects that already accomplish this, but not in the very specific way that I like to handle my personal organization, so might as well just do it myself.  It's good practice anyway!

The source is readable for now as a portfolio entry, but it is not free to be copied, forked, or used in other projects (assuming it gets to the point that others would find it that useful).  I may loosen this up in the future but for now I want to reserve rights just in case.
