This is the beginnings of a sprawling project of personal automation, starting simply with a to-do list.

There are many other projects that already accomplish this, but not in the very specific way that I like to handle my personal organization, so might as well just do it myself.  It's good practice anyway!

Current codename: Lifebot, but this is 100% temporary as that's already a thing that exists.  Will change name as soon as I think of a better one.

The source is open for now as a portfolio entry, but it is not free to be copied, forked, or used in other projects (assuming it gets to the point that others would find it that useful).  I may loosen this up in the future but for now I want to reserve rights just in case.
